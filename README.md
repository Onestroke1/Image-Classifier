# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains most of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Image Classifier Project.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the flower dataset which can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz). This dataset will need to be decompressed using a tool from [Rarlabs](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm). Place the dataset under the working directory _Image-Classifer_.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Image-Classifer/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
